## xkcli - set of tools for interacting with XKCD from the CLI

Have you ever dreamt of being able to search for a relevant XKCD strip in the middle of a conversation on IRC?

Enter XKCLI, the cli tool no one felt was needed, but you know, the author wants a toy project.

XKCLI works by creating a local index of strips, and then querying it.

It's mostly unimplemented as of now. You can contribute and finish it though!
